ðŸ”¹ **Overview**

â€ƒâ€ƒThis project introduces a novel AI-driven framework that combines optimization and game theory to promote fairness and transparency in jury selection and deliberation.  
â€ƒâ€ƒIt seeks to minimize systemic and interpersonal biases by modeling both demographic representation and behavioral interactions within juries.

ðŸ”¹ **Objectives**

â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Ensure fair demographic representation in jury selection.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Model juror influence dynamics during deliberation.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Apply optimization and game-theoretic techniques to reduce bias.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Provide a data-driven foundation for fair judicial processes.

ðŸ”¹ **Methodology**

1. **Fairness-Constrained Jury Selection**

â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Jury selection formulated as an optimization problem.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Selection governed by constraints ensuring minimum group representation.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ **Key variables:**  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ- `x_i`: binary indicator (1 if juror i is selected).  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ- `w_g`: demographic group weights.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ- `p_g`: non-response probabilities.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Algorithm adjusts iteratively to correct sampling biases and achieve representational fairness.  

2. **Game-Theoretic Deliberation Modeling**

â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Deliberation modeled as a non-cooperative game among jurors.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Juror strategies: **Assert (A)**, **Conform (C)**, or **Silent (S)**.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Payoffs influenced by belief strength, effort aversion, and susceptibility.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Introduces a novel **Interaction Equilibrium (IE)** extending **Nash Equilibrium** to social influence settings.

ðŸ”¹ **Applications**

â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ AI-assisted tools for jury selection fairness evaluation.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Simulation frameworks for behavioral studies and group decision-making.  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Potential integration in legal tech for court systems and civic fairness audits.

ðŸ”¹ **Conclusion**

â€ƒâ€ƒThis framework demonstrates how AI, optimization, and behavioral modeling can jointly enhance fairness, reduce bias, and strengthen the integrity of the criminal justice process.
