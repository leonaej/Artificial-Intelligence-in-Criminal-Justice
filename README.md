🔹 Overview

This project introduces a novel AI-driven framework that combines optimization and game theory to promote fairness and transparency in jury selection and deliberation. It seeks to minimize systemic and interpersonal biases by modeling both demographic representation and behavioral interactions within juries.

🔹 Objectives

Ensure fair demographic representation in jury selection.

Model juror influence dynamics during deliberation.

Apply optimization and game-theoretic techniques to reduce bias.

Provide a data-driven foundation for fair judicial processes.

🔹 Methodology
1. Fairness-Constrained Jury Selection

Jury selection formulated as an optimization problem.

Selection governed by constraints ensuring minimum group representation.

Key variables:

x_i: binary indicator (1 if juror i is selected).

w_g: demographic group weights.

p_g: non-response probabilities.

Algorithm adjusts iteratively to correct sampling biases and achieve representational fairness.

2. Game-Theoretic Deliberation Modeling

Deliberation modeled as a non-cooperative game among jurors.

Juror strategies: Assert (A), Conform (C), or Silent (S).

Payoffs influenced by belief strength, effort aversion, and susceptibility.

Introduces a novel Interaction Equilibrium (IE) extending Nash Equilibrium to social influence settings.


🔹 Applications

AI-assisted tools for jury selection fairness evaluation.

Simulation frameworks for behavioral studies and group decision-making.

Potential integration in legal tech for court systems and civic fairness audits.

🔹 Conclusion

This framework demonstrates how AI, optimization, and behavioral modeling can jointly enhance fairness, reduce bias, and strengthen the integrity of the criminal justice process.
